# INTRODUCTION

TestME is a fun, interactive website that engages the user in a general knowledge quiz with questions on geography, math, history, cooking and more. It is a timed multiple choice game, with random questions and answers each time the user starts the quiz.

## Features to implement in the future

1. Pause option

    * Features: add a pause option in the quiz box to allow the user to pause the quiz whenever he wants.
    * Reason for not featuring in this release: since, there is a time counter, the developer decided better not to put the pause option, since by setting this option the time counter will not be of any importance. But in the future, the developer will put this option and each time the user will press pause, the question he paused will automatically change when he will resume the quiz.

2. Info icon

    * Features: add an info icon in the quiz, near refresh and exit icons, to allow the user to review the instructions whenever he wants.
    * Reason for not featuring in this release: following the presence of the time counter, the info icon can delay the user in his quiz when he will press this to review the instructions. But in the future, the developer will put this option and each time the user will press info icon, the question will automatically change when he will exit the info box.

3. Implement the progressive Web Application (PWA)

    * Features: implement the PWA to allow users to install the application on their own devices.
    * Reason for not featuring in this release: the web developer needs more knowledge on this subject.
