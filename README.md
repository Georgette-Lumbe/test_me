# INTRODUCTION

TestME is a fun, interactive website that engages the user in a general knowledge quiz with questions on geography, math, history, cooking, eye and brain test and more. It is a multiple choice game, with random questions and answers each time the user starts the quiz.  The user can see the quiz instructions before starting and after completing the quiz they can see their score and have the option to replay the quiz and share their score to friends and TestME community on Facebook.

This is the second of five milestone projects that the developer is required to complete as part of their full web development course at the Code Institute. The main requirements were to create a responsive and interactive website using mainly *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *JavaScript*.

# UX

### The ideal user of this quiz

* Quiz lovers
* General culture lovers
* People who like general knowledge quiz
* People who like to exercise their brain
* People who like to test their general knowledge
* People who want to know new things
* People who want a quick, simple and elegant quiz application.

## User Stories

### As a new user:

* I would like to see where to start playing
* I would like to navigate easily to the website
* I would like to set the dark mode when I play at night.
* I would like to know the instructions before starting the quiz
* I would like to know how many questions I have left
* I would like to see how many questions that I got wrong
* I would like to leave the quiz whenever I want
* I would like to have a very clear feedback when I finish the quiz
* I would like to be able to share my score with my friends and TestME community on Facebook

### As an returning user:

* I would like to see new questions

### As a website creator:

* I want to make the quiz fun and interactive
* I want to ensure that there are enough questions
* I want to make sure that the user enjoys the quiz
* I want to provide an option for new and returning users to share their score on Facebook.

## Development Planes

To create an interactive and fun quiz that displays all data clearly with consistent styling across all pages, TestME creator worked with its developer to discern the required functionality of the quiz and how it would respond to the stories and expectations of users, as described above. 

### Strategy

The quiz will be focus on the following three categories of target audiences:

1. Demographic
    * All ages
    * People in any field
    * Learners

2. Position
    * New users
    * Returning users

3. Centre of interest
    * Quiz lovers
    * People who enjoy general knowledge
    * People who like to test their knowledge
    * People who want a quick, simple and elegant quiz application.

The online quiz needs to facilitate the user to:

1. Access informations below:
    * The instructions before starting to play  
    * The feedback after finishing to play
    * A Share score option on Facebook

The online quiz needs to facilitate the TestMe creator to:

1. Maintain an online presence
2. Get more players
3. Get multiple users to react on the official TestME facebook account by sharing their score and discuss.

### Scope

There are two categories of requirements that were defined in order to clearly identify what needed to be done to align the functionality with the previously defined strategy.

1. Content Requirements

    * The user will be looking for:
        - Where to start playing
        - The instructions
        - The feedback and score
        - Where to share score
        - Where to set the dark mode

2. Functionality Requirements

    * The user will be able to:
        - Navigate easily through the site to find information he wants
        - Find link to external site in order to stay connected with the TestME' community and share score

### Structure

The structure of the application has been designed to provide a simple and seamless user experience. A simple design will be implemented on all pages. The flow of the pages will be natural and will allow the user to feel comfortable after viewing a single page.

1. Header

    * The logo will serve as a link to the homepage
    * The label will serve to set the dark mode

2. The info box

    * The info box contains the instructions and the start quiz button at the bottom
    * The start quiz button leads user directly to the quiz

3. Quiz box

    * A counter to show what question the user is on
    * Questions
    * Three options which only one is correct
    * Next button at the bottom which will pass to another question
    * Correct and incorrect section, which show how many questions that the user got wrong and correct. 

4. Feedback box

    * A table of result that will tell the user his attempt, percentage, score, how many questions he got wrong and correct
    * Two butons at the bottom:
        - Play again: will lead again the user directly to the quiz
        - Share: will lead the user to Facebook where he can share his score with friends

5. Exit icon

    * On each box except the info box, there is an exit icon that can take the user back to the principal page

6. Footer

    * A Copyright

### Skeleton

Wireframes moch-up were created in a balsamiq workspace with providing a responsiviness and positive user experience in mind.

* Light Mode of home, quiz and feedback boxes:

<img src="assets/docs/screenshots/home_light.png" width="33%"><img src="assets/docs/screenshots/quiz_light.png" width="33%"><img src="assets/docs/screenshots/feedback_light.png" width="33%">

* Dark Mode of home, quiz and feedback boxes:

<img src="assets/docs/screenshots/home_dark.png" width="33%"><img src="assets/docs/screenshots/quiz_dark.png" width="33%"><img src="assets/docs/screenshots/feedback_dark.png" width="33%">

## Design

1. Typography

    * At the beginning of this project, the developer had opted for a combination of fonts [Balsamiq](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans?query=bals) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=monts) but after deploying the site and testing on mobile and tablet, he decided to change fonts and opted this time for a combination of [Mate SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mate+SC?query=mate) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=monts) fonts which are used throughout the quiz, with Sans SÃ©rif as a back-up font in case of import failure.

2. Colour Scheme

    * At the start of this project, the developer had opted for a rather complex colour combination, but after deploying the site and testing it on mobile and tablet, and seeing that he had to put it in dark mode, he decided to change the colours to something simple. 

    * The colours used throughout the site for its main styling are shown below, this mix of colours comes from [coolors](https://coolors.co/) and they were chosen for a better design to maintain a simplified pleasure for the user, he can change the mode when it suits him

    * These colours are used in a specific and complementary way, maintain a good level of contrast in both dark and light modes.
    * There is a layer of red for when the user will choose a wrong answer and and the layer of green when he will choose the correct answer.

3. Images and Icons

    * The images for some questions was sourced from [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/502855114653749177/).
    * Some icons have been used in the site. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was the main source of icons.
