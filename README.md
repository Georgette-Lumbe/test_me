# INTRODUCTION

TestME is a fun, interactive website that engages the user in a general knowledge quiz with questions on geography, math, history, cooking and more. It is a timed multiple choice game, with random questions and answers each time the user starts the quiz.  The user can see the quiz instructions before starting and after completing the quiz they can see their score and have the option to replay the quiz.

## Design

1. Typography

    * A combination of [Balsamiq]() and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=monts) fonts are used throughout the quiz, with Sans SÃ©rif as a back-up font in case of import failure.
    * For elements that need to be coloured, they have just been styled with the desired colour.

2. Colour Scheme

    * The colours used throughout the site for its main styling are shown below, this mix of colours comes from [coolors](https://coolors.co/) and they have been picked to keep within the design brief of maintaining a simplified pleasure.

    * These colours are used in a specific and complementary way, maintaining a good level of contrast.
    * There is a layer of red for when the user will choose a wrong answer and and gray to draw lines .
